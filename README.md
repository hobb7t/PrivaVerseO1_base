Greetings, and thank you for taking the time to read this!

PrivaVerse (as it turns out) is a private universe for self-hosting useful AI applications and tools to help with everyday tasks.
As we approach the end of 2024, we've seen how many organizations—especially private companies—generate and handle massive amounts of data and integrate large language models (LLMs) into various projects. These LLMs are tuned by our everyday interactions, highlighting their potential to make a meaningful impact on our daily lives by lending a helping hand where needed.
AI assistants, home automation, text-to-voice, sound generation, video creation, and image generation are just a few of the countless possibilities we can (and should) bring into our home labs.

This project is actively evolving. We’re gathering ideas and exploring ways to host multiple models under one unified setup.

### Key Components
**_Code Generation and Writing (Text-based AI):_**
- **GPT-J or GPT-NeoX**: Open-source models capable of generating text and code, designed to serve as versatile, general-purpose assistants.
- **Model Server**: Hosts the core model. We’ll use GPT-J-6B for balanced performance, with the option to upgrade to GPT-NeoX-20B for more demanding tasks, both managed through Text-Generation-WebUI.

**_Image and Video Generation:_**
- **Stable Diffusion**: A powerful model for image generation that also supports video tasks through plugins.
- **Stable Horde or Automatic1111 WebUI**: Provides easy management of Stable Diffusion tasks.

**_Automation Scripts and Task Management:_**
- **OpenAssistant (OASST)**: This open-source assistant is customizable for personal workflows, allowing for task automation, management, and more.
